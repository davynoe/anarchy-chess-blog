      <h3>How does the rating system work?</h3>
  
      <p>At the heart of Anarchy Chess lies the enigmatic Stragonov's Elegance Algorithm, a highly sophisticated quantum equation that would make even the most brilliant fictional physicists brain explode. Developed by our visionary team of chess rebels, this algorithm operates on a concealed supercomputer running the cutting-edge Q# programming language—a quantum leap beyond conventional chess rating systems.</p>
      <p>The father of this algorithm is no one other than the Russia's underappreciated quantum physicist Vasily Gurgen Stragonov, whose genius transcends the boundaries of reality. He is the mind that orchestrated the intricacies of the Elegance Algorithm, that is now being used in weaving together the tapestry of your chess journey with a blend of mistakes, brilliances, near-misses, and the ethereal dance of moves that traverse the realm of possible ideas.</p>
        
      <p>As you engage in the cerebral dance of Anarchy Chess, our hidden supercomputer meticulously assesses every facet of your gameplay. The algorithm, akin to a quantum symphony, computes a number that hovers around negative values, with rank 0 being the elusive pinnacle of excellence— a summit yet unclaimed by any mortal player or artificial intelligence.</p>
        
      <p>Your rank tier is intricately determined by the proximity of this negative number to the elusive rank 0. The closer you are to this mysterious zero point, the higher your standing in the hallowed tiers of Anarchy Chess. Brace yourself for a journey into the quantum dimensions of chess evaluation, where brilliance and mistakes are harmonized into a celestial rating that transcends the boundaries of ordinary competition.</p>
